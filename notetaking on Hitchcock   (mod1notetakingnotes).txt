notetaking on Hitchcock  http://historyonics.blogspot.ca/2013/12/big-data-for-dead-people-digital.html was using nvAlt with a workaround to save the individual notes once they were written to a desktop folder on Mac laptop called digitalhistory2016. Identified key concept as tags in the process of reading and taking notes:  digital history; spatial turn; situated knowledge; network analysis; distant reading; historical evidence; macroscope.  AT THE MOMENT, they are sitting as .txt files,  but need to re-engineer the automated export to desktop git (once installed) and sync with online git so they sit in my account. ah, the joys of dancing between two machines and potentially two platforms, given the WTAP work stations are set up on PC, yeah!

update: now that I have admin privileges on the mac and have been able to download and initialise github desktop, the challenge was to clone the new github repo research-notes and make it a local instance, in this case, a desktop folder (haven't found the github desktop folder into which it should belong nor the sync function the workbook says) then import the .txt files made in NV for the digitalhistory2016 folder and point the NV to the new research-notes folder (although still need to export as save and automate renaming losing the file name as the tag, grr).
 now need to work out commit - can't find sync function...
 
found the sync function, but of course, without the NV files pointing to the github folder (which is where?!) the sync doesn't work!
