APIs rule! after learning that need to install home-brew with jq and wget in the correct order, ran query on subset of Macdonald CWGC data to filter to WW1, then selected a cemetery (sissiness) and ran the following script over the canadiana.org site:
pages=$(curl 'http://eco.canadiana.ca/search?q=soissons&field=&so=score&df=1914&dt=1918&fmt=json' | jq '.pages')
curl 'http://eco.canadiana.ca/search/'${i}'?q=soissons&field=&so=score&df=1914&dt=1918&fmt=json' | jq '.docs[] | {key}' >> results.txt
sed -e 's/\"key\": \"//g' results.txt | tr -d "\"" | tr -d "{" | tr -d "}" | tr -s " " | sed '/^\s*$/d' | tr -d ' ' > cleanlist.txt
awk '$0="eco.canadiana.ca/view/"$0' cleanlist.txt| awk '{print $0 "/1?r=0&s=1&fmt=json&api_text=1"}' > urlstograb.txt
wget -i urlstograb.txt -O output.txt

had to install wget at this point, but ran last command and still worked

results sent to desktop - though not sure what the directory api was supposed to do - be location of results and urlstograb.txt files? 
anyway, now proud owner of 10 exact locations! may move them to the ./api folder and commit all to git.
