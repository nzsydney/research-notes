# nzsydney intro

As a latter-day book historian and letterpress printer with a passion for technology, both old and new, I have several aims in taking this course:

  - Firstly, to fill in alot of technical gaps. I know about tools and techniques, and work in research teams with colleagues that have these skills. However, as with my letterpress printing, I want and need to have hands-on experience to make them more real in order to better and more credibly guide the various digital research projects for which I am principal investigator and project manager;
  - Secondly, to participate in a landscape of practice that shapes and promotes its digital identity through the twin philosophies of openness and collaboration;
  - Thirdly and finally, to participate in and reflect on the pedagogy that shapes this course, both in the context of digital history and in a **COOL** = connected open online learning environment.

I am currently working on a three-year digital history research project entitled [Personal Geographies and Global Networks: William Colenso and the Victorian Republic of Letters](http://colensoandtherepublicofletters.weebly.com/).

Here's a studio portrait of one of my actors/agents, William Colenso (1811-1899), snapped in later life by Samuel Carnell of Napier:

Subject to discussions with Shawn, I'd like to use some of our nineteenth-century letter correspondence data and work through a tightly-scoped research question to produce an online exhibition as a form of [digital storytelling](www.storycenter.org/) and an alternative yet valid and empowering genre of scholarly publishing. This may be a prototype for an online tie-in of a physical exhibition running in conjunction with a conference in November on about New Zealand polymaths.

Connecting the dots will take some time, but it will be worth the investment. (btw, I live in a rural community that was only connected to broadband two months ago; we get 3G if we're lucky and only if the weather is not throwing us a southerly buster straight off Anarctica, so please be patient!)

I hope to give myself the gift of what is currently termed [Slow Scholarship](http://web.uvic.ca/~hist66/slowScholarship/) with its companionate spirits *Slogs* and *Sleets*. As John Lutz from the University of Victoria, Canada,  describes it:

> A Slog is a deliberate, even ponderous, injection into the world of ideas -- a part of the slow scholarship revolution. To the world of ideas a Slog is meant to be what slow food is to gourmands. If a good Blog goes stale after a few days of no posting, a proper Slog stays fresh for years without a new post.

Live the digital life as a considered life. Watch this pace.
