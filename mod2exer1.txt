CWGC exercise: tried several searches Shep no hits; Schoepp only 1; so went extra-familial to Colenso http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1 and have 11 hits, maybe not enough but perhaps better than Macdonald? 1871 hits http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1 [note same URL but file name shows different search request number] downloaded both as .csv files and parked in digitalhistory2016 folder on desktop. [note now automatically goes to folder, yeah, sorted that one out!)
